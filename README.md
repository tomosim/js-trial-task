# Trial Task

This task was completed by creating a React app within the project and having it consume the provided API. As such, you'll need to get both the FE and BE and running to get it working.

## Instructions
1. clone this repo
2. install the dependencies for the express app and start it running
    
    ```
    npm i
    npm run
    ```
3. in a seperate terminal, change directory to `/client` and install dependencies

    ```
    cd client
    npm i
    ```
4.  finally, in `/client` run 
    ```
    npm run
    ```
    and the front end will spin up. You can view it at `http://localhost:3000`
